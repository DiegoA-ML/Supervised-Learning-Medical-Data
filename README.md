# Supervised-Learning-Medical-Data
Diagnosed the presence and severity of a heart disease, with the use of machine learning algorithms such as, decision tree, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine. We show the algorithm generated from scratch and compare it with the algorithm generated by scikit-learn.
